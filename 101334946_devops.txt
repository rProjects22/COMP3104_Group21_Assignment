Teacher's name: Pritesh Pate
Course Code: COMP 3104
Academic Year: 2022-2023
Term: Fall
The course consists of 8 quizzes, 8 labs, 2 assignments, midterms, and finals.


This course is designed to better prepare professionals entering the IT field.
Specifically, a field where servers, web apps and infrastructure will be core to
business needs. COMP 3104 will provide a hands-on experience through the
implementation of tried, tested and true DevOps technologies.
We will also examine ways in which companies have either lost or saved fortunes
with DevOps strategies. Learning about Amazon Web Services, Ansible, Docker and
Travis CI, you will become familiar with end-to-end deployment processes. You will
also have your very own build pipeline which will allow you to push changes to a
web app in the wild at the stroke of a key.
Using DevOps practices effectively will allow for a process predicated on ease to
ship code to Production servers, apply hot-fixes, catch errors before they produce
some sort of unintended behavior and keep transparency & communication
heightened across all teams. Looking at the software development lifecycle
through the lens of a DevOps Engineer will produce a more informed and qualified
developer.
